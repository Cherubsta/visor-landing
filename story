                <h2>A Parent’s Journey</h2>
                <p>
                    As a parent of two, I was frustrated with the lack of tools to create a safe and enriching YouTube experience for my family. 
                    It started as a small project for my kids, but soon, every parent I talked to said, "I wish I had that."
                    That’s when I realized this app wasn’t just for my family—it could help families everywhere.

                <h2>Behind the Name</h2>
                <p>
                    The name "Visor" came to me during my daughter's second-grade gathering, called "Cuddle Up and Read." 
                    My wife was reading a book aloud when the word "visor" came up. My daughter asked what it meant, and my wife explained: 
                    "A visor is something you put over your face to protect it." I realized that "Visor" perfectly described what the app does—it’s a layer of protection for families in a digital world.
